#  Execution Trace Reconstruction Using Diffusion-Based Generative Models
This is the official repository for the Execution Trace Reconstruction Using Diffusion-Based Generative Models, accepted in ICSE 2025. In this work, we introduce a novel application of diffusion-based generative models for reconstructing traces, conduct a thorough evaluation of four models using several distinct system call sequence datasets, and compare against other approaches. 
## Datasets
The trace data used to make each dataset are publicly available:

The sequence datasets created using these sources are all found in the `Datasets` folder. 

## Training and Evaluation
The code used to train and evaluate the $`SSSD^{S4}`$, $`SSSD^{SA}`$, $`CSDI^{S4}`$, and DiffWave models can be found at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/AI4HealthUOL/SSSD). The trained models are found in the `Models` folder. The results obtained using these models using different sequences lengths (50, 100, 150, 200) and blackout sizes (1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40) are found in the `Results` folder.

The code used to train and evaluate the LSTM baseline is in the `LSTM` folder.
